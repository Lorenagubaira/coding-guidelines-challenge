## üå±  How to start this project

## üìù Instructions

1. Wait for your mentor to open [these slides](https://coding-guidelines-challenge.vercel.app).
2. Try completing the challenge with the whole class, and have an open discussion and suggestions.
3. Once the challenge is finished, split into groups; as many groups as possible as long as there is one mentor in the group. For example: If there are 2 mentors in a class of 10 students, we will have 2 groups of 5 students each.
5. One student at a time will open your previous codes and start discussing them with their classmates.
6. The mentor will intervene as needed to ensure the group stays focused and on the right path.
